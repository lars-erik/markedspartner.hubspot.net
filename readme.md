# MarkedsPartner HubSpot Net

This is a temporary effort to create a .NET Core client for HubSpot
based on a handwritten OpenAPI specification.

When [HubSpot is "done"](https://github.com/lars-erik/markedspartner.hubspot.net.git)
publishing their specs, this will be updated to be generated from the
"official" spec instead.

To generate the .NET client you need to install the [nswag CLI tool](https://github.com/RicoSuter/NSwag/wiki/CommandLine).
